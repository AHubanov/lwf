You can use Adobe FLASH(TM) as powerful authoring tool with talented Flash artist. As a result, you can have rich content within short time.\r\n\r\n LWF is a technology to make 2D game assets such as props, character animations and user interfaces assets by using FLASH and play these assets during game-runtime on the top of HTML5 or Unity where FLASH player is not supported.\r\n\r\n## Features and benefits\r\n- Scene data is player-independent. Scene data can be played both on HTML5 and Unity without any modification.\r\n- Flexible rendering system. A cocos2d-html5 is supported as well.\r\n- Game oriented and production proven APIs.\r\n- Tuned and production ready rendering performance.\r\n\r\n## LWF in production\r\n- \"Animal Days\" and \"Alien Family\" are using LWF technology.
