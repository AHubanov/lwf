# LWF - Lightweight SWF

 LWF is a technology to let you have animated 2D character animations and 2D user interfaces easily.

 Generally speaking, making rich 2D character animations and user interfaces are expensive area. You can use Adobe FLASH(TM) as powerful authoring tool with talented Flash artist. As a result, you can have rich content within short time.

 LWF is a technology to make 2D game assets such as props, character animations and user interfaces assets by using FLASH and play these assets during game-runtime on the top of HTML5 or Unity where FLASH player is not supported.

## Features and benefits
- Scene data is player independent. Scene data can be played both on HTML5 and Unity without any modification.
- Flexible rendering system. A cocos2d-html5 is supported as well.
- Game oriented and production proven APIs.
- Tuned and production ready rendering performance.
